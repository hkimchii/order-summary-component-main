## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My biggest learning point from this challenge was the importance of the workflow when designing a responsive page. I did begin by
designing the mobile view size but it was without any intention or purpose (had I realised earlier that there were designs for two different viewports I might have worked on both simultaneously ðŸ˜‚). It was only much later in the project that I realised by focusing on one screen size first, it's easier to make needed changes for different view port sizes.

### Continued development

I want to continue to focus on using flexbox and other position properties. I am still not completely comfortable using different techniques to layout the design exactly the way I want to.
